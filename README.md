# LAN Party VPN - VPN for Virtual LAN Parties

Have you ever wanted to play a classic game with your friends but not
able to because you or your friends cannot get a LAN or VPN set up?

LAN Party VPN (LPVPN) to the rescue! LPVPN allows you to create a VPN
over Discord so you can set up a VPN in seconds. No installation
required!

   Run the downloaded file. Ask your friends to do the same.

2. **For Host (Yourself):** Click `Host`, **For Clients (Your friends on Discord):** Click `Join`.
