Have you ever wanted to play a classic game with your friends but not

## Usage

Go to Releases and download one of the precompiled exes. For most
people this should be the `x86_64` version. Run the downloaded file.

Ask your friends to do the same.

Click on `Host` to host a VPN. Click `Invite` to invite friends on
Discord. Use your Discord client to select which users to invite.

For your friends: click `Join` instead and accept the invitation in
Discord.

You are good to go! Your IP address will be shown in the UI. The VPN
will be disconnected once you close the Application.
